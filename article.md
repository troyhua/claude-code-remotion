# MSA: How We Gave a 4B Model 100-Million-Token Memory

**Scaling LLM memory to human-scale — with sparse attention, KV compression, and a tiered hardware pipeline.**

---

Long-term memory is the missing piece in today's LLMs. Even frontier models cap out around 1M tokens. We wanted to push that to 100 million — without sacrificing precision, without an external RAG pipeline, and while keeping everything end-to-end differentiable.

The result is **Memory Sparse Attention (MSA)**: a sparse attention architecture that compresses, routes, and retrieves from massive KV caches at inference time, achieving less than 9% performance degradation across four orders of magnitude (16K → 100M tokens). It runs on a single 2×A800 GPU node.

Here's how we solved each technical challenge.

## 1. Compressing the Memory Bank

The first problem is representation. Storing raw KV caches for 100M tokens is prohibitively expensive. We need a compact, structured format that still preserves enough signal for high-precision retrieval.

**[Video: GlobalMemoryEncoding]**

During an offline stage, every document in the corpus undergoes a single forward pass. The backbone's standard projection weights generate Key and Value matrices (K, V). Simultaneously, a specialized **Router K Projector** — a learned layer trained alongside the model — generates routing keys (K^R).

All three matrices are then segmented into fixed-length chunks of P=64 tokens and compressed via **chunk-wise mean pooling**, producing compact representations: K̄, V̄, and K̄^R. These are cached in a structured memory bank.

This is done once per corpus version. The compression reduces the memory footprint by approximately L/P (where L is document length), converting raw text into an optimized latent store ready for high-speed retrieval.

## 2. Making It Fit: Tiered Memory Storage

Even after compression, the KV cache for 100M tokens requires approximately **169GB** — exceeding the 160GB aggregate VRAM of a standard 2×A800 node. Monolithic GPU storage is physically impossible.

**[Video: TieredKVStore]**

The key observation: during the routing phase, the system only needs the routing keys K̄^R to determine which documents are relevant. The actual content (K̄, V̄) is only required *after* a document is selected.

This insight enables a **tiered storage strategy**:

- **GPU VRAM**: The compressed routing keys K̄^R (~56GB for 100M context) are **distributed across multiple GPUs** using a Memory Parallel strategy. Each GPU holds a shard and scores its portion independently.
- **CPU Host DRAM**: The bulk content matrices K̄ and V̄ are offloaded to host memory. They are fetched asynchronously to GPU only for the Top-k selected documents.

This decouples total memory capacity from VRAM limits, enabling 100M-token inference on standard hardware.

## 3. Sparse Routing: Finding Needles in 100M Tokens

At inference time, the model must instantly identify the most relevant documents from the entire memory bank — without computing dense attention over everything.

**[Video: SparseAttentionRouting]**

When a user query arrives, its hidden states are projected through a **Router Q Projector** to produce a routing query vector Q^R. This vector is broadcast to all GPUs in the system.

Each GPU independently computes relevance scores between Q^R and its local shard of K̄^R using **cosine similarity**, with a hierarchical aggregation pipeline:

1. Scores are averaged across attention heads
2. Maximum pooling is applied across query tokens to get per-chunk scores
3. The per-document score is the maximum across its constituent chunks

Scores are then gathered globally via all-reduce, and the system selects the **Top-k** most relevant documents across the entire 100M-token bank.

An important architectural detail: this routing is only applied in the **latter half** of the model's layers. Empirical analysis shows early layers lack the high-level semantic abstractions needed for effective retrieval — they are better suited for local context processing.

## 4. Context Assembly and Generation

Once the Top-k documents are identified, the system assembles a sparse but highly relevant context and generates an answer — all in a single differentiable pass.

**[Video: ContextAssembly]**

The compressed K̄ and V̄ for the selected documents are asynchronously fetched from CPU DRAM into GPU VRAM. These are concatenated with the query's local Key and Value matrices (K_q, V_q) to form a unified **sparse context**:

> K_ctx = [{K̄_topk}; K_q],  V_ctx = [{V̄_topk}; V_q]

The model's standard attention mechanism then computes interactions between the active query Q_q and this assembled context, generating the answer autoregressively. Because routing, retrieval, and generation are all internal to the model's attention layers, the entire pipeline is **end-to-end differentiable** — no external retrieval system, no heuristic reranking.

---

## 5. Scaling Positions: Document-wise RoPE

A fundamental challenge in scaling to 100M tokens: standard positional encodings assign monotonically increasing position IDs across the entire concatenated sequence. A model trained on 64K contexts will encounter position IDs in the millions during inference — far beyond anything it has seen, causing catastrophic performance degradation.

**[Video: DocumentRoPE]**

MSA solves this with **Document-wise RoPE**: each document in the memory bank receives **independent position IDs starting from 0**. This completely decouples positional semantics from corpus size — the model's position encoding only needs to handle individual document lengths, never the total token count.

For the active query, we apply **Global RoPE** with a strategic offset: position indices start from k (the number of Top-k retrieved compressed KV chunks). This ensures the model perceives the query as a causal continuation of the retrieved background information, preserving coherent generation.

The result: train on 64K, infer on 100M. Position IDs always remain within the training distribution.

## Results

MSA demonstrates unprecedented scalability:

- **<9% degradation** from 16K to 100M tokens on MS MARCO QA
- **94.84% accuracy** on Needle-In-A-Haystack at 1M tokens (vs. 24.69% for the unmodified backbone)
- **16% average improvement** over same-backbone RAG systems across 9 QA benchmarks
- Competitive with frontier systems using **235B-parameter generators** (KaLMv2 + Qwen3-235B), despite being a 4B model
- All running on a **single 2×A800 GPU node**

By effectively decoupling memory capacity from reasoning capability, MSA provides a scalable foundation for endowing general-purpose models with intrinsic, lifetime-scale memory.
